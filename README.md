# RL-DDPG-Parking-Agent-Carla-Simulator
 Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Agent using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Parking a Vehicle in Carla simulator
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This implementation was the main part of my BSc thesis.
 
 To run this program, this project should be cloned into some new folder in PythonAPI folder provided by Carla Simulator. Version of Carla
 Simulator used for this implementation is 0.9.10. 
 
 Main program is located in parking_agent.py. 
 To run this program, first you should run CarlaUE4.exe (simulator provided by Unreal Engine), and then run this program through Command Prompt as py -3.7 parking_agent.py
